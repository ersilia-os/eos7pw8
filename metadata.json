    "Title": "Bayesian prediction of synthetic accessibility",
    "Description": "SYBA uses a fragment-based approach to classify whether a molecule is easy or hard to synthesize, and it can also be used to analyze the contribution of individual fragments to the total synthetic accessibility. The easy-to-synthesize dataset is an extract of the ZINC purchasable compounds, and the hard-to-synthesize dataset is generated using a Nonpher approach (introducing small molecular perturbations to transform molecules into more complex compounds). The fragments are calculated with ECFP8 descriptors, and independence between fragments is assumed.\n",
